wavs/1.wav|Great. 
wavs/2.wav|Node js. 
wavs/3.wav|Angular react. 
wavs/4.wav|Amazing. 
wavs/5.wav|Ruby on rails. 
wavs/6.wav|Even awesome dot net. 
wavs/7.wav|Awesome. 
wavs/8.wav|But let's not forget. 
wavs/9.wav|That there is a monster out on the web and we call it as. 
wavs/10.wav|Wordpress. 
wavs/11.wav|It still holds majority of the market share. 
wavs/12.wav|And there is something very important happening right now. 
wavs/13.wav|This is a once in a decade opportunity which wordpress is providing to all of the programmers. 
wavs/14.wav|And this is the time where you can probably launch a product and earn millions from it. 
wavs/15.wav|No this is not a get quick rich scheme. 
wavs/16.wav|This is just a market opportunity that is presenting itself and since this is a less talk topic on the internet. 
wavs/17.wav|I thought. 
wavs/18.wav|Let's.
wavs/19.wav|Share some thought on this. 
wavs/20.wav|Hey there everyone hitesh here and from last. 
wavs/21.wav|one and a half month i am totally busy in just consulting with some of my old client. 
wavs/22.wav|From the companies where i. 
wavs/23.wav|Work and provide my consultancy. 
wavs/24.wav|And trying to convince them that world is evolving the wordpress is changing a lot. 
wavs/25.wav|You need to change right now because as. 
wavs/26.wav|You are gonna get delay in the change it can get more costly and. 
wavs/27.wav|Expensive. 
wavs/28.wav|Right now is the time for doing so. 
wavs/29.wav|But as usual clients are always very very rigid and a saying that everything is working fine in our website. 
wavs/30.wav|So why do we need to make this change. 
wavs/31.wav|Not just this is a change from the development side. 
wavs/32.wav|This is also a change at their entire organisation level. 
wavs/33.wav|People who are writing the entire articles for them they need to understand this change as well. 
wavs/34.wav|As well as the entire organisation needs to have a policy what to use what to not to use. 
wavs/35.wav|They need to go through weather. 
wavs/36.wav|A retraining of how they were writing entire thing and let me explain in a little bit more detail. 
wavs/37.wav|We have been using wordpress for a while and a lot of people complain that wordpress is. 
wavs/38.wav|Looking a little bit older it's performance is not that much great which is also true. 
wavs/39.wav|But a lot of people still use wordpress. 
wavs/40.wav|Now obviously wordpress needs to evolve as the web is evolving. 
wavs/41.wav|And they are now moving away from the classic editing style in writing styles of basically that classic editor is going away eventually in the future. 
wavs/42.wav|And they are moving into block base. 
wavs/43.wav|Content. 
wavs/44.wav|So everything that you do not create whether that's navigation bar a footer maybe a page maybe a post. 
wavs/45.wav|Everything is now eventually going to. 
wavs/46.wav|Follow the process of creating a blog editing the blog and. 
wavs/47.wav|Managing the blocks. 
wavs/48.wav|Yes.
wavs/49.wav|Block. 
wavs/50.wav|Kus.
wavs/51.wav|We will have headings blocks. 
wavs/52.wav|Paragraph blocks. 
wavs/53.wav|Images block. 
wavs/54.wav|May be a lot of things. 
wavs/55.wav|And eventually this blocks are gonna get reusable so that performance can be improved a little bit. 
wavs/56.wav|So when this project gutenberg. 
wavs/57.wav|Was introduced to everybody some people liked it some people didn't like it. 
wavs/58.wav|The people who didn't like it. 
wavs/59.wav|Also came to know that there is a plugin known. 
wavs/60.wav|Classic editor we can install that and get away from the guttenberg or the block based writing. 
wavs/61.wav|Because for people who are writing these article. 
wavs/62.wav|Difficult for them to manage at the just click of a button. 
wavs/63.wav|But.
wavs/64.wav|They didn't. 
wavs/65.wav|Understood the fact that. 
wavs/66.wav|Classic editor was introduced. 
wavs/67.wav|So that people can have a gradual adoption. 
wavs/68.wav|Instead they thought that this gutenberg is going to get. 
wavs/69.wav|Sideline. 
wavs/70.wav|And eventually those people who don't like and continue to use the classic editor which is not. 
wavs/71.wav|How the things are going to get. 
wavs/72.wav|Into the future. 
wavs/73.wav|The future is gutenberg. 
wavs/74.wav|Everything is gonna be managed by gutenberg your navigation bar and pretty much everything that i mention is gonna go in that direction. 
wavs/75.wav|What impact this is going to make. 
wavs/76.wav|No my friend this is not going to make impact this is already making impact. 
wavs/77.wav|From last couple of months wordpress is sending the updates which are. 
wavs/78.wav|A breaking update. 
wavs/79.wav|These are breaking the classic editor and some the custom functionality that you are introducing. 
wavs/80.wav|Because they were already clearly mentioned that everything is gonna move into the gutenberg direction. 
wavs/81.wav|So when the clients are saying that our website is working fine. 
wavs/82.wav|This is right now eventually in the very near future. 
wavs/83.wav|The website is about to break and to convince the client. 
wavs/84.wav|What are you doing right now is about to break you need to go through the changes right now is a little difficult because sometimes plan thing. 
wavs/85.wav|It was just charging unnecessary money. 
wavs/86.wav|Revamping the website. 
wavs/87.wav|But that's not the case and that's what exactly i am trying to convince them. 
wavs/88.wav|If you think that's only the problem. 
wavs/89.wav|That's just. 
wavs/90.wav|The Start. 
wavs/91.wav|The problem comes with training of the staff as well. 
wavs/92.wav|This is a block based editor now. 
wavs/93.wav|You will have a lot of plugins that also give you some more functionality. 
wavs/94.wav|For example let's say you're using headings. 
wavs/95.wav|In your articles. 
wavs/96.wav|Then there are some of the plugins that you can install and these are not plugins these are blocked that you can install. 
wavs/97.wav|And they will provide you some more styles of the headings. 
wavs/98.wav|So when you click on the heading. 
wavs/99.wav|They will give you 5 different types of heading. 
wavs/100.wav|They need to have a policy across the organisation to. 
wavs/101.wav|Just instruct everyone that whenever you need to use heading we use. 
wavs/102.wav|This. 
wavs/103.wav|Kind of heading. 
wavs/104.wav|Now This includes. 
wavs/105.wav|Having a policy throughout your organisation having the policy being conveyed. 
wavs/106.wav|To your all the articles writer who ever is writing those blog post. 
wavs/107.wav|This is just the start. 
wavs/108.wav|The whole story short. 
wavs/109.wav|Guttenberg is here you need to adopt it right now. 
wavs/110.wav|And you need to convince all of your clients to. 
wavs/111.wav|Just get into the gutenberg right now. 
wavs/112.wav|This is going to involve a lot of. 
wavs/113.wav|Meetings with the clients and trying to convince them but let me bring you to another aspect of admit to the business. 
wavs/114.wav|Almost a decade ago and opportunity was presented in front of developers because wordpress was great but it requires some of custom functionalities. 
wavs/115.wav|And thus. 
wavs/116.wav|Plugins were born a lot of people just introduced thier plugins because they were either frustrated with something. 
wavs/117.wav|Or wanted to bring something for everyone so that they can use. 
wavs/118.wav|And eventually. 
wavs/119.wav|This plugins. 
wavs/120.wav|Kind of a blow blow on the entire market. 
wavs/121.wav|And everybody wanted that so people started to launch their premium version of the plugin and made good amount of money even. 
wavs/122.wav|Companies that. 
wavs/123.wav|Hiring. 
wavs/124.wav|Probably thousands of people. 
wavs/125.wav|And also there was some of the editors which made your life a little bit easier to design and develop the website. 
wavs/126.wav|This was the opportunity that came to the programmer. 
wavs/127.wav|A decade ago. 
wavs/128.wav|And now since the same thing is happening again. 
wavs/129.wav|Gutenberg is here. 
wavs/130.wav|A lot of people are going to face some issues because just alone the wordpress. 
wavs/131.wav|Cannot just resolve the problems or just serve everybodys need. 
wavs/132.wav|So eventually the customise. 
wavs/133.wav|Plugins or the customise blocks are going to be introduced by the people and they are already lots of plugins. 
wavs/134.wav|Which are block based are ordered in the market but not that many. 
wavs/135.wav|So here comes the opportunity for this rest of the entire year people will be. 
wavs/136.wav|Struggling to move into the gutenberg. 
wavs/137.wav|Trying to design the website trying to write article. 
wavs/138.wav|Define to manage everything. 
wavs/139.wav|The previously written plugins. 
wavs/140.wav|Are already showing some of the breakage they are not compatible with the gutenberg they need to rewrite it. 
wavs/141.wav|This is a great opportunity when you can just introduce your click in your concert or whatever something that is making loud problem. 
wavs/142.wav|India trying to solve that problem. 
wavs/143.wav|We can introduce your product. 
wavs/144.wav|10 base product or just apply again. 
wavs/145.wav|And justice for all the market. 
wavs/146.wav|If market responds well. 
wavs/147.wav|This can be an opportunity for you. 
wavs/148.wav|To roll out an entire business. 
wavs/149.wav|Summing up the entire video. 
wavs/150.wav|Gutenberg is the new update by the wordpress and this is how the things are going to move into the future. 
wavs/151.wav|You need to convince your client that this is how the things are going to go for the. 
wavs/152.wav|You can take help of this video as well send it to our clients and say that this is out in the public. 
wavs/153.wav|And everybody is aware of it this is not something that charging extra money. 
wavs/154.wav|This is something that is eventually going to happen. 
wavs/155.wav|Also this is an opportunity right now that you can discuss with your friends or you can just designs on a product which is. 
wavs/156.wav|Just surrounding the guttenberg update. 
wavs/157.wav|I can launch something into the market. 
wavs/158.wav|This is a great opportunity to test out the things of early move into the next business or if you are a company. 
wavs/159.wav|Just design something amazing and fall you can launch if you are having the early mover advantage right now. 
wavs/160.wav|We are also testing outside the product if they run. 
wavs/161.wav|Create a pattern. 
wavs/162.wav|That's another day. 
wavs/163.wav|I hope that you have enjoyed this very quick update about the situation at you should know there is a law that where you should give your thoughts. 
wavs/164.wav|And in this video the thoughtful little bit all around the places but these are. 
wavs/165.wav|All the information that you should really really know. 
wavs/166.wav|Understand before buying a domain. 
wavs/167.wav|Aaj ki video general thought. 
wavs/168.wav|Let's go ahead and talk about. 
wavs/169.wav|Domain names. 
wavs/170.wav|Recently i've been buying a couple of domain name some of them are really really expensive some of them and not able to get them. 
wavs/171.wav|I also own a couple of three letter domains like elsia dot there. 
wavs/172.wav|I am also doing some expensive ones like build resume. 
wavs/173.wav|In. 
wavs/174.wav|And the couple of them are trying to buying which are not getting. 
wavs/175.wav|This made me realise that. 
wavs/176.wav|There is a lot about the domain name that is going around and there is a lot of thought process. 
wavs/177.wav|Among variety of us. 
wavs/178.wav|Which things the domain names are important which says domain names are not important. 
wavs/179.wav|Let me present all the fight share and let me decide you the. 
wavs/180.wav|All domain name. 
wavs/181.wav|Important or should you be buying one or not. 
wavs/182.wav|The first. 
wavs/183.wav|And foremost i would like to address those audience was a. 
wavs/184.wav|We don't need a domain name for even our own portfolio we adjust students with don't need domain. 
wavs/185.wav|We can use free domains wine at least five versal amazon and we can just work around with that. 
wavs/186.wav|We don't mind having a dot net li fi at the end of that works well at the end. 
wavs/187.wav|Aur even get a provide pages. 
wavs/188.wav|Just walk around with that at this point i completely disagree with you even if your presenting your portfolio your resume to any company. 
wavs/189.wav|These metal fibre seldom doesn't really intrigue anyone this doesn't look professional. 
wavs/190.wav|And specially when these days when two means are available like detect the main just for 75 rupees. 
wavs/191.wav|Dot info domain for job. 
wavs/192.wav|300 rupees. 
wavs/193.wav|How we can save that amount of money and keep on buying does mcdonald's burgers of get yourself a domain. 
wavs/194.wav|Pointed wherever. 
wavs/195.wav|Basil net li fi. 
wavs/196.wav|Anything that you want but at least get yourself with the name. 
wavs/197.wav|And ho. 
wavs/198.wav|All of your projects there it looks. 
wavs/199.wav|Find a bit more professional. 
wavs/200.wav|Now that you are on the same page with me that we should actually be buying the domain but the next question comes up is. 
wavs/201.wav|Should i be buying a dot com. 
wavs/202.wav|Erail dot in. 
wavs/203.wav|That app dot io. 
wavs/204.wav|Tata. 
wavs/205.wav|Something. 
wavs/206.wav|Entirely different on all of that. 
wavs/207.wav|Noa. 
wavs/208.wav|Selection of a domain is entirely very tiring process i completely agree on that part. 
wavs/209.wav|But the big question here is that. 
wavs/210.wav|Is dotcom still relevant we have come really very far in buying the domain name. 
wavs/211.wav|On march 15 1985 symbolics dot com was the first domain that got register with changed the entire internet history. 
wavs/212.wav|And still you can visit that website and they opened the claim that we are we are the oldest of the meaning. 
wavs/213.wav|But surprisingly to you for entirely over a month nobody. 
wavs/214.wav|About buying any 2 minutes. 
wavs/215.wav|On april 24th 1985 we can see that there is almost a one month gap. 
wavs/216.wav|The second domain that got registered was bbm dot com. 
wavs/217.wav|I can see that. 
wavs/218.wav|Pragathi people didn't care about the dot comma any of the domain. 
wavs/219.wav|But interestingly you should also know that. 
wavs/220.wav|A lot of marketing a lot of money was poured into the dotcom domain because the big business is worth buying the dotcom. 
wavs/221.wav|And i want to present an authority over the audience mind that this is the only domain you can trust. 
wavs/222.wav|And they are not totally wrong. 
wavs/223.wav|In the initial days of computer a lot of people were playing tricks on these dotcom name. 
wavs/224.wav|For example if you have xyz dot com people were buying x y z dot net org. 
wavs/225.wav|Android putting a malicious file people were not that smart at that point of time. 
wavs/226.wav|And they were visiting these alternative website getting the computer crash. 
wavs/227.wav|Eventually people realise that if this is a dotcom. 
wavs/228.wav|This means that is reliability that is a guarantee. 
wavs/229.wav|And all other domains means scam. 
wavs/230.wav|Maybe viruses maybe. 
wavs/231.wav|Something malicious links or something like that. 
wavs/232.wav|Yes all the time dot com was getting a lot of priority and even search engines were giving a lot of priority but the important key word here is. 
wavs/233.wav|World. 
wavs/234.wav|Domains are still a fascinating subject but not to the reason. 
wavs/235.wav|Startups and entrepreneurs who are getting started. 
wavs/236.wav|Nad dot in domain is quite alot preferred dot tech domain. 
wavs/237.wav|Quite popular dot tab to main is popular among the developers as well. 
wavs/238.wav|Infection an interesting study that i would like to present to you and most importantly this study is from manga. 
wavs/239.wav|2017 it is old. 
wavs/240.wav|And that make the study extremely extremely interesting. 
wavs/241.wav|This is a study from yc combinator which is like. 
wavs/242.wav|H di maker for all the startup founders day all love to go there and their other start of studies as well. 
wavs/243.wav|It cleans that in 2017. 
wavs/244.wav|Only 68% of starter which were owning at dot com. 
wavs/245.wav|Frequency. 
wavs/246.wav|This is. 
wavs/247.wav|Flushing down from hundred percent to 68% in 2017. 
wavs/248.wav|Heha.  
wavs/249.wav|You can imagine how this is going down. 
wavs/250.wav|This year into 2032 or 2020. 
wavs/251.wav|This is even falling down a lot of the main doesn't even care about dotcom. 
wavs/252.wav|The impact like to put in money to establish their brand and create a unique identity. 
wavs/253.wav|Different and unique kind of domain names. 
wavs/254.wav|And do you know any starter which came up around the law. 
wavs/255.wav|Five years and doesn't own a dotcom domain. 
wavs/256.wav|And still insanely popular let me know in the comment section which such sort of a is something that you know about. 
wavs/257.wav|Ok so this might bring you to onto a page where you se dot com is not that much rather than 20 days. 
wavs/258.wav|But yeah me out that's why i told you this videos as extremely interesting. 
wavs/259.wav|Another side of the story as well there are a couple of companies which are extremely popular one of them is delicious. 
wavs/260.wav|Delicious got there to main extremely sorted out. 
wavs/261.wav|Very creatively very amazingly but where they are right now. 
wavs/262.wav|Delicious dot com. 
wavs/263.wav|Another interesting example of a company who doesn't own a dot com but still extremely popular is join me. 
wavs/264.wav|Join me was there to me. 
wavs/265.wav|But where they are now. 
wavs/266.wav|At. 
wavs/267.wav|Join me dot com with eventually got acquired by another company but that's another story. 
wavs/268.wav|Still we can see that there is still some relevance on to the dot com. 
wavs/269.wav|And which brought me that how much money somebody can spend in buying a dot com domain is in same. 
wavs/270.wav|Even there are a lot of things these days which are. 
wavs/271.wav|Say good while purchasing a domain. 
wavs/272.wav|Companies might show you that this domain is available. 
wavs/273.wav|But when you login move into the purchase section they say hey this is not available. 
wavs/274.wav|Our manager extra fees and we might be able to get it for you. 
wavs/275.wav|And you will be surprised to know how much people are willing to pay for just a dot com. 
wavs/276.wav|Car insurance dot com was bought by paying 49 million dollars insurance dot com. 
wavs/277.wav|A private jet voice i do understand a some of them are pretty interesting like that number 10 11 12 13 the interesting. 
wavs/278.wav|Buffet ka insurance dot com almost 50 million dollars. 
wavs/279.wav|Aa That's. 
wavs/280.wav|That crazy for me. 
wavs/281.wav|Another side of this story is domain can also attract some kind of. 
wavs/282.wav|Camping techniques and ho laughing. 
wavs/283.wav|In india a lot of people are not aware about how to check properly domain. 
wavs/284.wav|And that is where subdomains also come into the picture for example big bank like. 
wavs/285.wav|Hdfc bank. 
wavs/286.wav|Sbi they don't own a proper domain like hdfc dot com are sbi dot com. 
wavs/287.wav|Example hdfc hdfc bank dot com. 
wavs/288.wav|Sbi on. 
wavs/289.wav|Online sbi dot com. 
wavs/290.wav|And sometimes people. 
wavs/291.wav|Sick leave by some kind of similar looking domain. 
wavs/292.wav|And they put this as a subdomains online sbi dot com going dot com. 
wavs/293.wav|And people see this is a. 
wavs/294.wav|Bank website and try to get. 
wavs/295.wav|Cancer there is another side of the data. 
wavs/296.wav|Ok if this all is sound fascinating to you. 
wavs/297.wav|Let me bring you to another side of the story the single letter domain which is. 
wavs/298.wav|Also another interesting subject on the dot com. 
wavs/299.wav|There are no single letter domain is available of course of yearly. 
wavs/300.wav|But there are certain. 
wavs/301.wav|Ko. 
wavs/302.wav|Single letter domain which are available for example. 
wavs/303.wav|T dot com is a sin to twitter dot com and the border. 
wavs/304.wav|I am pretty sure it was really really help of an expensive. 
wavs/305.wav|But some of them are. 
wavs/306.wav|Phone by just one company. 
wavs/307.wav|Amazon ke dot com xe dot co diesel all owned by amazon just one company of course. 
wavs/308.wav|G dot com is owned by google. 
wavs/309.wav|Badhiya they are not available for you or me. 
wavs/310.wav|Sadly. 
wavs/311.wav|I wish i could have one just h dot com. 
wavs/312.wav|I don't have that kind of money also. 
wavs/313.wav|Almost a year ago our little while ago there was a news that. 
wavs/314.wav|Elon musk bought. 
wavs/315.wav|Single domain x dot com. 
wavs/316.wav|If you visit this website there is nothing on the west side as of now there is. 
wavs/317.wav|X. 
wavs/318.wav|The letter x. 
wavs/319.wav|I am pretty sure this is bought by elon musk advice would be crazy 2 by eden park in x. 
wavs/320.wav|Just bare. 
wavs/321.wav|Although in the domain registration if you look for who is. 
wavs/322.wav|It is owned by godaddy itself. 
wavs/323.wav|I am pretty sure this kind of craziness. 
wavs/324.wav|Yes i got this. 
wavs/325.wav|Ok this. 
wavs/326.wav|Brings us to the final topic or the final section of the video which is a web 3 dot 1. 
wavs/327.wav|93 dot 2 a lot of domains are getting attention as well especially the dot 8th domain and interestingly a lot of people have already registered the domain with the name of google even mcdonald's and hole of other. 
wavs/328.wav|Some of them are owned by single person or entity or company whoever is there address is there. 
wavs/329.wav|Badhiya these domains are also getting pretty popular. 
wavs/330.wav|Have you got any idiots domain as of now because i haven't got any one. 
wavs/331.wav|Button definitely planning to buy. 
wavs/332.wav|Also just as a side note. 
wavs/333.wav|Rediff dot com was the first. 
wavs/334.wav|Indian domain that was registered i was looking crazy all over the domain. 
wavs/335.wav|While searching for my dementia i thought let's share this with you as well not coming back on the topic as a summary of this video yes domains are pretty important interesting. 
wavs/336.wav|Some people prefer dotkom some people prefer and non dot com domain which can be little bit more. 
wavs/337.wav|On the portable side but having a dot com domain or any domain is really really important. 
wavs/338.wav|Make sure you don't care about that kind of thing. 
wavs/339.wav|As quickly as you can get just buy a domain for yourself maybe you will be able to keep it for longer time. 
wavs/340.wav|It will give you more thought over the internet you can put all of your portfolio and maybe one day you will launch a product with that. 
wavs/341.wav|And this brings us to the sponsor of the us media first singer. 
wavs/342.wav|Navi used hosting account a lot in working with all of our clients. 
wavs/343.wav|Client comes up. 
wavs/344.wav|I always ask them that hey please buy a domain from hostinger hosting a god a lot of good support and i think that although we are helping these businesses creating their website for abs. 
wavs/345.wav|The domain is something really personal and should always remain with the founder of the company. 
wavs/346.wav|Or the owner of the business that's why we. 
wavs/347.wav|Always ask that hate please by the domain by yourself.
